# AWS CDK Dependencies

This repository uses the [AWS CDK Dependencies Action](https://github.com/spencerbeggs/aws-cdk-dependencies) to generate a single module npm module containing all the releases' packages and peer dependencies. If you want to keep your AWS CDK project in Typescript tracking [CDK's release cycle](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases) you can simply install this as a single dependency.
